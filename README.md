# Note-Taker

Title: Note-Taker

Usage/Description:
This assignment is to allow user to a take a note and save it into a server so that after refresh the page can still populate the saved notes. 

How does this work:
1- When you land on the page, they are presented with a page with a field to enter a note title and the actual note. 

2- As user enter these information a Save icon displays and user can save the note entered.  

3- User is also able to delete a note by clicking on the delete icon next to the note. 

4- When the page is refreshed, they saved note should render and display on the left side of the page.
